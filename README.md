This is a mod of One Month Rails - a parody pinterest style application to learn and develop in Rails. 

It uses Bootstrap, Devise (to add users), Paperclip (for images), jQuery Masonry (for pins layout), and endless scroll.

The app for viewing and testing can be found on heroku: http://ancient-forest-2475.herokuapp.com/.
